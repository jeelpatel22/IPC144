Ans(1): Instead of hardcoding "magic" numbers, utilising variables and macros to express information has a variety of benefits (constant literals). In the beginning, it makes the code simpler to read and comprehend. 
	  Giving a constant variable a descriptive name makes it much apparent what that value stands for and makes it simpler to comprehend its function in the code.  Second, it increases the flexibility and maintainability
	 of the code. Instead of having to walk through the entire codebase and make the change in several locations, the constant's value just needs to be altered in one location,which will make the code easier to read and understand.
	Additionally, it increases the code's reusability. A value can be utilised in several locations in the code when it is represented by a variable or macro rather than needing to be copied into each location.
	It is preferable to construct sum and average logic independent of any validation method for two reasons. First of all, it makes code maintenance and debugging simpler. It is simpler to understand what the code is 
	doing and spot any issues when the validation and calculation logic are separated. Additionally, addressing one problem won't lead to the emergence of additional problems since if the calculation logic has a fault, 
	it won't effect the validation logic and vice versa. 

Ans(2): The first importance is that separating the average and total values from the logic is that it will make the code easier to read and understand.
	also another reason is that, it makes the code more portable and easier so that it will makes it more flexible as well and can be more easy for user to 
	understand and read also if any other user or reader will read the code then it will also make it easier for the second user as well.Additionally, it will
	make easier for user to solve any error as user can easily read through the programme.
