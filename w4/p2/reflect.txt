Ans 1. Code formatting is very important while coding because it makes the code easier for 
	reader and user to read and understand it. Also user can find an error easily if he 
	follows code formatting method as it makes easier for user to read. I have made this
	using statements and loops with proper variables in an organized way which will help 
	reader to check the code. In this programme, I havee used if-else statement in order 
	to run the condition in programme also I have only  used do-while loop in the code
	because, by using this loop we can stop the programme without using breakn statement
	that is why I find this loop appropriate for this code.Finally, in order to get the 
	result shown in workshop pdf I have to use scanf statement many times as we have to 
	take user input data.

Ans 2. Nested logic is one of the important tool that can be used while coding as it helps a lot 
	when we try to make long programs. We can use nested logic while running any loop or any condition.
	In my program, I have used nesting method in if-else statement and in do-while loop which connects
	each condition to each other as well each loop to each other. For example, I have used do-while loop from
	the start of the programme and written the whole program inside it and also did the same in if-else statements.

Ans 3. If we use only if statement in the code then compiler would run the program by checking each 
	if statement individually and it will make the programme more longer  and if we use if-else-if 
	statement instead of only if statement then compiler will first check the if condition then it will 
	go to the else statement and after that it will go to if statement and it will make the program
	more easier and short .
