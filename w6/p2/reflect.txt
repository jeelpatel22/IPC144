						Answer:

Ans(1): In programming, there are basically three different forms of iteration constructs(loops): "while," "for," and "do-while."
While any of these iterations can be used to produce the same outcome, each one has a unique structure and is most effective
when applied to the specific situation.For loops are more common among programmers and work well when iterating over a fixed 
range like when iteration is known we should use this loop as it will precisely run the loop as many times as we want (iteration number).
When the number of iterations is unknown in advance and the condition is written outside the loop body, "while" loops are more
appropriate.Do-while loops are ideal when you want your loop to run even if your initial condition is incorrect, and they are also 
appropriate when the loop condition need to be changed as it will check the condition of the loop in the last.The "For" loop is the
best choice when working with arrays since it makes it simple and effective to iterate over each element of the array.The "For" loop syntax
is the one to use when working with arrays since it provides a simple method for initialising, iterating, and accessing the items of an array.

Ans(2): Testing and debugging can be done in a variety of ways in programming, but in this case, I chose the unit testing method, which requires
me to separate the code into its component parts and test each one separately.This strategy makes it simple for the users to spot any errors
because we check that each component is functioning properly or not.In programming, there are two sorts of errors: syntactic and semantic 
problems. Debugging is the process by which we need to detect the errors and change them.The compiler can simply fix the syntactic issue since it will 
highlight it when we use incorrect syntax or the inappropriate keywords, which causes the error.Semantic errors happen when we apply the incorrect logic 
in the code, and they are extremely difficult to identify and call for extensive testing and debugging.I used print statements in the code to identify unexpected
values that could lead to a semantic error so we could fix it. Print statements allow us to take the output of variables and other data at specific points in the code,
which will be helpful to identify unexpected values that could lead to a semantic error.These are the techniques I have used to test and debug my code.

Ans(3): Below are the steps that we an use in order to fix the error:
  
a) Open the output.txt file and w6p2 master output.txt, which has the proper output.
b) Compare the character in column 33 of line 6 in both files by looking at line number 6 in both files.
The ASCII code for "0" should appear in character column 33 of line 6 in the ideal result (48).
Instead of the anticipated "0," the character column 33 in our output file contains the ASCII code for "5" (53) instead.
b) Change line 6 of our code to read "Input your monthly NET income:$0" in order to print the actual, correct output.
d)change this code, save it, and then run it again to create a new output file.
e)Resubmit your work if the new output corresponds to the right output; otherwise, repeat the previous steps.
