Ans(1): As we can observe the programme (code) for the game play part of the workshop has successfully done the non-repetitive sections of logic. In this program, I have used loops 
in order to avoid the repetition in the code and it has worked too.To be more precise, I have 
used loop in game play section to print the symbols and to avoid repetation.

Ans(2):Honestly, if we have to do this code without using structures then it would be more difficult and long as well. By using structures in it we can store multiple variable value in one variable and can execute it easily.For example, if we want to store my age,marks,student id and other information then I can use structure to store these information at one place because we will have the same person but different values and if we have used different variables for every infrmation then the code will be too lng and complicate that is why we need to use structure to make code short and easy to understand.

Ans(3): In my code I have used do-while loop in which I have used nesting method which starts from  printf which has Next move[1-20] part in it and after that I have used if-esle condititions and I have even used for loop in it.

do
{

do
{
}while(nextMove <1 || nextMove>20);
if()
else if()
else if()
else if()
else if()
if()
for()
for()
{
if()
else
}for()
{if()
else if()
else
}
}
}
